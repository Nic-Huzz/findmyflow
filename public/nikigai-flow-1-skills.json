It solves a problem, for a person, using a set of skills.\n\nBy identifying skills we're passionate about using, people we're passionate about serving and problems we're passionate about solving - I believe we can identify our dream business opportunities and jobs.\n\nThe whole process is inspired by a Steve Job's quote 'you can't connect the dots looking forward, you can only connect them looking back'.\n\nThis question flow will focus on identifying skills you're passionate about by reviewing different periods of your life.\n\nFor each question, aim for 5+ bullet points. See each bullet point you answer with as a dot and the more dots we have the better.\n\nReady to start?",
