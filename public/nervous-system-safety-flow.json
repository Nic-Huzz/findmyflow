Safe to earn. Safe to be seen. Safe to succeed.\n\nAnything beyond that boundary? It pulls you back. Not because you lack capability—but because expansion feels dangerous to your system.\n\nThis is why ambitious people self-sabotage. Not because they're broken. Because their nervous system is protecting them from something.\n\nLet's discover where your boundaries are—so you can expand them.\n\nWe'll use something called the Sway Test to identify these subconscious limits.",

Your body has its own language. Let it show you.\n\nIf you're skeptical, that's okay.
