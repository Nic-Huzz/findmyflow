Now — based on what you've shared, **choose one persona to move forward with**.\n\nIf you're unsure which audience to move forward with, here are a few principles to guide your decision:\n\n• Wealth-based problems are often the most straightforward to sell, because the return is measurable. If someone spends $X and can see how they might earn $Y in return, the value is clear.\n• Health-based problems come next, because the results are still quantifiable — losing x amount of kilos and adding x amount of muscle mass, the transformation can be clearly linked to the investment.\n• Love and emotional challenges are often the most meaningful but also the hardest to monetize, since the outcomes are less measurable and more subjective.\n• In general, the more painful the problem, the more motivated the person is to take action and pay for a solution.\n• The higher someone's income, the more they can afford — and that often means you can charge more for premium solutions.\n• If you already know people like your target audience, that's a great sign — the more people you know, the faster you can test and sell.\n• Finally, consider the trend: a growing market means new people are entering the space all the time, which increases your opportunity over the long term.\n\nWhich persona do you want to build your offer around?",
