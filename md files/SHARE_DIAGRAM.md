# 📊 How to Share Your Castle Architecture Diagram

## Option 1: View Locally (Fastest)
Just open the file directly in your browser:
```
file:///Users/nichurrell/Findmyflow/castle-architecture.html
```
Or simply double-click `castle-architecture.html` in Finder.

## Option 2: GitHub Pages (Free & Shareable)

If you push this to GitHub, you can enable GitHub Pages:

1. Push your repo to GitHub
2. Go to Settings → Pages
3. Select your branch (usually `main`)
4. Your diagram will be available at:
   ```
   https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/Findmyflow/castle-architecture.html
   ```

## Option 3: Add to Your Vercel Deployment

Since you're using Vercel, the HTML file in your repo root will be automatically served. After you push:

1. Your diagram will be available at:
   ```
   https://YOUR-VERCEL-URL.vercel.app/castle-architecture.html
   ```

## Option 4: Use Mermaid Live Editor

I've prepared the diagrams for Mermaid Live Editor. Visit:
- https://mermaid.live/

Then copy and paste the Mermaid code from `CASTLE_ARCHITECTURE.md` into the editor. You can share the generated URL.

## Option 5: Quick Static Hosting

If you want to share immediately without pushing to GitHub:

1. Visit https://www.netlify.com/drop/ (no account needed)
2. Drag and drop the `castle-architecture.html` file
3. Get an instant shareable URL

**Recommended:** Option 3 (Vercel) since you're already using it - just push and access it via your domain!
